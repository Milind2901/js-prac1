/* 

On basis of how data is stored in memory and how it can be accesed ,
data is divide into 2 types - 

-- primitive                 ( original value ke sang chedchad "nahi" kar sakte memory mei )
-- non primitive              (original value ke sang chedchad kar sakte hai memory mei )

# Primitive : 7 types  - Strings  , Numbers , Boolean , Null , Undefined , Symbol (used to set uniqueness), BigInt , 

# Reference Type/ Non Primitive  ( direct access of valuess in memory is allocated )
- Arrays , Objects , Functions 

=> JS is dynamically typed language cause the datatype of variable is determined by the value it holds during the runtime 
   and can change throughout the protgram as we assign different values to it 


Return type of variables in JavaScript

1) Primitive Datatypes

       Number => number
       String  => string
       Boolean  => boolean
       null  => object (*****)
       undefined  =>  undefined
       Symbol  =>  symbol
       BigInt  =>  bigint

2) Non-primitive Datatypes
       Arrays  =>  object
       Function  =>  function(object)
       Object  =>  object
